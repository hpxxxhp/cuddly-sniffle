// 1) Via "for" console every odd number from 20
// 2) Replace "for" on "while"
// 3) Face-control
// const age = prompt("How old are you ?");

// if <= 18 => get over here
// if > 18 => get out of here

// until user <= 18 ask him about his age

// 4) Output every simple number from 100;
// 5) Get number from user and get factorial of this number
// 5 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 125
